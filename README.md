# Attendence-Sorting
Many Small Business, Calculate the Employee's Attendance and Break Timings through the Punch In &amp; 
Punch Out Machine, But While Sorting the attendance through the Excel File Method may be time consuming, 
there we bring in R studio to manage the Attendance and the Break timings of the Employees with respect to their Employee ID
The Code Capture's the First Check as you login and your Last Punch out as your Log-out, 
also all the punch in between this time goes as Break timings.
